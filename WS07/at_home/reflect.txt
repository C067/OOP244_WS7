Reflection:

1. No the Hero class does not need to know about the existence of the SuperHero class
because we are using the Hero class to make the SuperHero class. The reason why the Hero
class doesn't need to know about the SuperHero class is because the Hero class is a seperate
class in general. Its purpose is to store the name, health and attack of a hero. Then, it 
calculates which hero is victorious.

2. Yes the SuperHero class does need to know about the existence of the Hero class because
the Hero class is a base of the derived class, SuperHero. The SuperHero class is based on the
data members and functions of the bass class. The only difference, the derived class can 
have their own data members and functions. 

3.The reason why the program prints out, "Ancient Battle!" because a Hero is fighting a
SuperHero. When a SuperHero fights a Hero, the SuperHero can't use any of their super powers
making it a fair fight against a Hero as a Hero only has three data members. To determine this, 
the Hero constructor is called first; this assigns both ojects with the same amount of data 
members. 

4. Both of the following definitions are true because you are initializing both objects with 
a 3-argument constructor for each object. The object will then store data into each constructor 
and then call the operator function.
